# ECEn-240-301-grading
Grading guidelines for ECEn 240/301 Spring 2024. 

Grading rubrics can be found in [rubrics/labs](/rubrics/labs), and some resources for grading in learningsuite can be found in the [resources](/resources) folder. Grading assignments are in [TA_Grading_Assignments.md](/TA%20Grading%20Assignments.md)

If you have any suggestions, please either let me know or submit a pull request. If TAs from future semesters are viewing this, feel free to fork this and use it, as well.

Credit to Anna Holm for most of the rubrics resources. I just gathered it all onto github.
