Lab 4:
Learning Suite:
1. What is the effect of different values of resistor: 1M, 10M, 100M.  Why do you observe this phenomenon? (5 points)
-2 if they don’t say that it increases the sensitivity.
-2 if they don’t have some explanation for why. Usually includes a mention of tau and how that changes things. (But it’s a harder question, so be lenient).
3. Paste the Arduino code for Milestone 1. (240 should include code used for measuring the capacitance) (10 points)
 (240) -5 if no code for measuring capacitance 
-3 if the code has the wrong calculation for tau.
 float tau = measuredTime/(log((1-beta)/beta));
-10 points if they didn’t include any code
-5 if it’s not the separate sketch. We want them to realize they were supposed to use that code we gave them.
(A lot of 240 kids have only submitted the one capacitance code, and not the little sketch that everyone does. Give them credit anyway because it is a little confusing).
4. Paste your Arduino code for Milestone 2 (20 points)
-3 if their tau threshold is 25. That means they didn’t change it.
-5 if the capacitive sensor isn’t implemented correctly (i.e. not using analogWrite or something crazy)
-10 if the code obviously doesn’t work
5. Paste a link to your video below: (30 points)
Full points if they follow rubric outlined below (next page)
0 points if you can’t see the video. Add the comment:
Your video is not public. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link to the video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
-3 points if they resend the video. 
6. <240 Only>. Upload your lab report here (PDF only!). (30 points)
# Remember to use the slide rubric as well.
For 301: Give them the same points here as you gave them for Question 5.
For 240: Use the rubric on Learning Suite to assess the quality of the lab report. 
Note: Most 240 lab reports should get full points as long as they put in effort, it looks professional, and they included most of or all the diagrams. 
-3 if no graphs of different tau values getting plotted
-3 if no description of how the different resistors and capacitors change the graphs.
-3 if no pictures with explanations of the oscilloscope of the different pulse width of the motors. (the 100% often shows up as a straight line)
-3 if the scope plots don’t have the duty cycle measurement on them.
-3 if not professional (this has to be really bad to take this off).
-3 if no introduction or conclusion
-3 if not a PDF
7. In what ways could this lab be improved? (1 point extra credit)
This usually grades automatically, but people often put “nothing” or something of the sort. Please check this and make sure it is right.  
-1 point if they do not answer it with some real feedback. 
Video Rubric:
-3 points for no name on the breadboard
-3 points they miss one of the following speeds
Stop
Low
Medium
High
-3 points if they are running their robot connected to the computer
-3 points if no talking explanation (like explaining what buttons they’re pressing)
-3 points mentioned above for having to request permission for the video.
