Go to [How to Grade in Learning Suite.md](/resources/How-to-Grade-in-Learning-Suite.md) 
to see how to get to the grader and begin grading. 

Note: "-3" means subtract three points.

# Lab 5:

```1) Paste your Arduino code below:```
- 0 points if they didn't submit any code. Email or message them requesting it.
  - -5 points if they send the code. 
- -5 if they aren't implementing isLight().
- -10 if the code obviously doesn't work. 

```2) Paste a link to your video below: (35 points)```
- 0 points if you can’t see the video. Add the comment:
  > Your video is not public. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link to the video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they resend the video.
- 0 points if you can't see their name on the breadboard. Add the comment:
  > Your video does not have a name on the breadboard. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link a new video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they send a new video, although if the original video would have had a lower score then give them that score.
- If their video is sus (you're not sure it's their own work) then ask the grading TA what to do. 
##### Video Rubric:
This video should show their robot with motors and photodiodes, with the servo LEDs and the motors working according to the photodiodes. 
- 0 points for no name on the breadboard (see above).
- -3 points if they miss one of the following: 
  - Servo Up LED
  - Servo Down LED
  - Drive Left
  - Drive Right
- -3 points if they are running their robot connected to the computer. 
- -3 points if no talking explanation of how it works.
- -3 points mentioned above for having to request permission for the video. 

```3) <ECEn 240 only>  Add your lab report here (PDF only!). (35 points)```
- For 301: Give them the same points here as you gave them for Question 2.
- For 240: Use the rubric on [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/.YoSI/cid-d8RgIfkKFPjI/student/pages/page/id-vIiK) ([download](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/plugins/Upload/fileDownload.php?fileId=f7dfd05e-fpKi-a1kw-5SBC-52ec5754a070)) to assess the quality of the lab report. 
  - Note: Most 240 lab reports should get full points as long as they put in effort, it looks professional, and they included most of or all the diagrams.
  - -2 for each item missing from the [list on the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wSx2OFlLH3TO9DeCfRdZftI9dApcQ05J3uZ1rJw_IPI/edit?subsessionID=6WFL#slide=id.g11c1269870d_0_7712). 
- -3 if it's not a pdf. 

```#) In what ways could this lab be improved? (extra credit)```

This usually grades automatically, but people often put “nothing” or something of the sort. Please check this and make sure it is right.  
- -1 point if they do not answer it with some real feedback.
