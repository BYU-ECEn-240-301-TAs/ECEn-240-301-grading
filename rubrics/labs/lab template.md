Go to [How to Grade in Learning Suite.md](/resources/How-to-Grade-in-Learning-Suite.md) 
to see how to get to the grader and begin grading. 

Note: "-3" means subtract three points.

# Lab #:

```#) Paste your Arduino code below:```
- 0 points if they didn't submit any code. Email or message them requesting it.
  - -5 points if they send the code. 
- (Lab specific deductions.)
- -10 if the code obviously doesn't work. 

```#) Paste a link to your video below (make sure the settings are public, so anyone can see it):```
- 0 points if you can’t see the video. Add the comment:
  > Your video is not public. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link to the video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they resend the video.
- 0 points if you can't see their name on the breadboard. Add the comment:
  > Your video does not have a name on the breadboard. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link a new video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they send a new video, although if the original video would have had a lower score then give them that score.
- If their video is sus (you're not sure it's their own work) then ask the grading TA what to do. 
##### Video Rubric:
This video should show...
- 0 points for no name on the breadboard (see above).
- (Lab specific deductions.)
- -3 points if no talking explanation of how it works.
- -3 points mentioned above for having to request permission for the video. 

```#) <ECEn 240 only>  Add your lab report here (PDF only).```
- For 301: Give them the same points here as you gave them for Question 10.
- For 240: Use the rubric on [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/.LoN4/cid-d3NCoTVPrS1X/pages/id-vIiK) ([download](https://github.com/mazzeob/ECEn-240-301-grading/blob/03862e905b21ec297db446267fca538f2a583fff/resources/Grading%20rubric%20for%20lab%20report%20in%20ECEn%20240.pdf)) to assess the quality of the lab report. 
  - Note: Most 240 lab reports should get full points as long as they put in effort, it looks professional, and they included most of or all the diagrams.
  - (listed deductions)
- Give a warning if they didn’t submit as a pdf or if they submit a .heic picture.
- -5 if it's not a pdf and it's after the first lab. 

```#) In what ways could this lab be improved? (extra credit)```

This usually grades automatically, but people often put “nothing” or something of the sort. Please check this and make sure it is right.  
- -1 point if they do not answer it with some real feedback.
