Go to [How to Grade in Learning Suite.md](/resources/How-to-Grade-in-Learning-Suite.md) to see how to get to the grader and begin grading. 

Note: "-3" means subtract three points.

# Lab 3:

```3) Why is it important to have a power switch on the robot? (3 points)```

If they have something about saving battery power from being drained or not needing to physically take the battery in and out as an answer, then give full points.
- -3 if the answer doesn’t make sense

```4) What happens when you plug a voltage greater than 5.5V into the wrong Arduino pin? (3 points)```

Say something about breaking the Arduino, frying the pin, or the computer.
- -3 if the answer doesn’t make sense

```5) Why is it important that the H-bridge heatsink be unobstructed? (3 points)```

They need to say something about it overheating or being damaged.
- -3 if they obviously don’t know what an H-bridge is.

```6) Upload your robot computer code here. (25 points)```
- 0 if they don't submit any code. Send them an email or message requesting it.
  - -5 if they send the code. 
- -5 if they didn’t change the LED_2s and LED_4s to ENABLE A and B. (Most students used H_BRIDGE_ENA and H_BRIDGE_ENB)
  - (Note) Still give them the points if they use a different variable name that shows they aren't using LEDs anymore. 
- -10 points if the code obviously doesn’t work.
- <240 only> -5 if no battery monitor .

(NOTE) If their code isn’t the skeleton code, still give points if it appears that the code functions. 
Just leave a note that we strongly suggest that they use the skeleton code.

```7) Paste a link to your video below:```

- 0 points if you can’t see the video. Add the comment:
  > Your video is not public. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link to the video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they resend the video.
- 0 points if you can't see their name on the breadboard. Add the comment:
  > Your video does not have a name on the breadboard. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link a new video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they send a new video, although if the original video would have had a lower score then give them that score. 
##### Video Rubric:
This video should show the name on the breadboard.
- -3 points per each of the combinations listed below: (note: they do not need their wheels on for this)
  - driving left
  - driving right
  - driving straight
  - collision interrupts driving.
- -3 points if no talking explanation (like explaining what buttons they’re pressing)
- -3 points mentioned above for having to request permission for the video. 
- (240) -5 points if the battery monitor doesn’t work as expected. 
  (Some students ran their power supply through the h-bridge, which may make the LED’s dimmer. It just has to clearly show switching up and down with the power supply.

```8) <240 Only>. Upload your lab report here (PDF only!).```
- For 301: Give them the same points here as you gave them for Question 10.
- For 240: Use this rubric: ([view](https://github.com/mazzeob/ECEn-240-301-grading/blob/03862e905b21ec297db446267fca538f2a583fff/resources/Grading%20rubric%20for%20lab%20report%20in%20ECEn%20240.pdf)) to assess the quality of the lab report. 
  - Note: Most 240 lab reports should get full points as long as they put in effort, it looks professional, and they included most of or all the diagrams. 
  - -3 for each item missing from the [list on the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bRNqjw3a6zD_Y3cUu_lPnDKNUE5umjfIw2C8jvXlpt0/edit#slide=id.g2dfa256ad93_13_0). (These are the content points from the rubric). 
- -3 if not a PDF

```9) In what ways could this lab be improved?```

This usually grades automatically, but people often put “nothing” or something of the sort. Please check this and make sure it is right.  
- -1 point if they do not answer it with some real feedback.
